            I'm quite enthusiastic about <span class="fw-semibold">Competative Programming(CP)</span> but I unfortunately haven't been able to
            do any CP for almost a year. I do plan to get back into it slowly though(wish me luck :D).
            Besides that I'm also interested in <span class="fw-semibold">Web-Dev</span> though I'm not a big fan of styling side of it, this
            website is a proof lol. I have been meaning to explore some <span class="fw-semibold">AI/ML</span> stuff somewhere down the line as well 
            but I currently have a lot to learn with higher priority that that.
            Also some of the platforms I like to use for CP are
            <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://codeforces.com/" target="_blank">Codeforces</a> and
            <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://atcoder.jp/" target="_blank">Atcoder</a>

            Outside of these STEM stuff, I'm a music lover(I mostly listen to Pop ig idk). I almost always have
            spotify playing on the background :p
            Reading is a hobbie I picked up recently and it has been quite fun. I have been reading manga for a while 
            now but was never really into nowels/books. Im primarily reading Young-Adult Rom-Fantasy.
            Last book I started:

            Well I'm 21 years old, currently living in Warsaw, Poland. I was supposed to graduate this spring
            but I'm starting semester 5 this October. Why? Well covid-19 hit me harder than it did most. I went though a severe depression during which I lost interest
            in everything including my studies. Having no one to talk to made it even more difficult and I was not
            able to tell my parents about it either since they were not particularly happy about me choosing to study abroad so they 
            would probably just blame that. I distenced myself from everyone to the point where I didnt even speak for weeks 
            at all. I fortunately met some amazing people(mostly online) who helped me get through it all. I have since been trying
            to better my relationship with my parents and friends, and overall trying to follow a healthy lifestyle.
            This also reminds me of one quote thats stuck in my head:
            <span style="display: block; " class="fw-semibold">
              "An attitude change, even if it seems forced at first, does wonders."
            </span>
    
            <img 
              style="display: block;"
              class="w-75 h-75 my-5 ms-3"
              src="{% static 'main/EREN_FINALLY_FREE.jpg' %}" alt="eren finally free? panel">
            
            Regarding career, out of all the areas I have explored  so far I found Backend Engineering to be the career I can pursue and enjoy.
            But I'm still very young and am willing to try out many more :)
